      <p>Petities.nl and Petitions.eu belong to the stichting Petities.nl, on the web <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051017052754/http://petities.nl/">since 1 May 2005.</a> Our aim is to make it easier for Dutch citizens to sign or start a petition which should be answered. Since 16 June 2008 the recipients of petitions can open a desk in this website to receive and answer petitions.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This service is made possible by professional volunteers, <a href="http://www.digitalepioniers.nl/projecten/Petities-nl/59">subsidies</a>, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101209065053/http://www.burgerlink.nl/eparticipatie/instrumenten-eparticipatie/Petities-nl2.xml">temporary professional support</a> and donations. Petities.nl is recognised by the Dutch Tax Authority as <a href="http://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontenten/belastingdienst/business/other_subjects/public_benefit_organisations/">a Public Benefit Organisation</a>.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The foundation is erected in February 2004 by ReindeR Rustema, Arjan Widlak and Michiel Leenaars and can be found in the register of the Chamber of Commerce <a href="https://server.db.kvk.nl/TST-BIN/ZS/ZSWWW01@?TYPE=NDNR&NDNR=34206249&NSDN=&submit=">with number 34206249</a>. The board now consists of ReindeR Rustema, Johan Kok, Liesbeth Dillo and Michiel Leenaars.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Technically the site is made possible by the volunteers of the 'Open Domein' association. From them you can get a <a href="http://deds.nl">free e-mailadres without advertising with respect for your privacy</a>. Then you can also <a href="http://opendomein.nl/lidmaatschap/">become member (for €15 per year)</a> if you appreciate the technical support of this kind of internet projects.</p>&#13;
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

    aftersigning:
      - answer: Sign by entering your name and e-mail address and confirm your signature from the e-mail you receive. On the page where you confirm, you can invite others to sign. You can send invitations by e-mail or use social media. On the same page you can also indicate you would like to help or donate.
        title: How can I support a petition more?
      - answer: Unfortunately, we require one e-mail address per signature to make it easy for the majority. No need for a password and each signature is connected to a person who can read e-mail. The way out is to either sign on paper and send/e-mail this to the lead petitioner or get an (extra) e-mail address. You can get an e-mail address for free from Open Domein, the organisation which also hosts this website. More details solutions in our <a href="https://handboek.petities.nl">handbook</a>.
        title: We share an e-mail address or my friends do not have e-mail. Can we sign only once?
      - answer: Sign a petition again with the same e-mail address as you have used before and and we send you the confirm e-mail with the link to the personal page. Follow this link and you change your name or description. You can also always hide or modify your name or description and you can change your other settings.

      descr: "<p>You can always change or hide your signature. Easily, by following the same link again we sent you to confirm your signature. You will find the options on the page that will appear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you lose that e-mail? Just sign again and you get a copy.</p>"
      title: Change your signature
    general:
      - answer: Petities.nl aims to overcome the usual shortcomings of online petitions, we ask&#58;<br>&#149; to address each petition to a recipient in the position to change matters as requested<br>&#149; to have a petitioner responsible as a spokesperson and contact about the petition; no anonymous petitions without someone responsible<br>&#149; petitions to deal with the public interest, no consumer issues<br>&#149; for constructive petitions by requiring a sender and clear observation and demand<br>&#149; preventing spam for signatories.<br>In general we want to enable and improve the constitutional right to petition.
        title: Online petitions are pointless I am told. Why is Petities.nl different?
      - answer: You can not sign anonymously. You can sign without showing your name publicly. When you sign you should tick a checkbox to allow your name to be shown publicly. When you do not allow this, only three persons can see your name&#58;<br>&#149; The recipient of the petition, usually the government.<br>&#149; The petitioner, who manages the petition.<br>&#149; Petities.nl, who manages the website. You can always tick or empty this checkbox.
        title: Why are anonymous signatures allowed?
      - answer: Those who receive your petition are handed a list of signatures to verify. Hypothetically a politician or civil servant might contact you personally when they expect you can give a valuable insight on the petition. Practically they only talk to the petitioner, as spokesperson for all signatories. The recipient of a petition can not send a mailing to all signatories, because this is prohibited by the <a href="https://www.cbpweb.nl/">dataprotection law</a>. After all, our database is not created for that purpose and therefore the data can not be used for it. The webmaster and systeemadministrator of petities.nl have access to all this data. The Petities.nl Foundation aims for distinction from competing action sites with reliability and neutrality. We operate under Dutch legislation on servers in the Netherlands from a non-profit organisation which is not for sale. Unused data is actively deleted (storing no data is always the safest policy). The lead petitioner only has access to the name-function-place data for the hand over. Included are the 'anonymous' signatories, not publicly visible on the website. This list may not be published (protected by the dataprotection act) and may only be handed over to be verified. And to impress of course! Elected representatives know how difficult it is to voluntarily make someone sign for something...

    opinionpiece:
      descr: A petition gets most signatures from allies who are already convinced by the need for change. But most are not! If they know about the petition at all. With opinion piece in the newspaper or online you can both inform and convince people. This text is usually more pleasant to read than a petition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To write such a piece is not difficult&#58; it is all about the opinion supported by arguments. Send your piece to a newspaper or a website accepting contributions from others. You can also write an opinion piece to draw attention to someone else's petition. Do not forget the call to sign the petition!

    whilesigning:
      - answer: When a petition is closed for signing the button to sign does not appear under a petition. A petition closes before the hand over and then awaits an answer. You could contact the lead petitioner to add your signature if the petition is not formally handed over.
        title: Why can I not sign a certain petition?
      - answer: It can happen you signed with an e-mail address you can not access (anymore). You notice this when you do not receive the confirmation e-mail within some 15 minutes after signing. Also requesting that e-mail again does not work, because it goes to an address where you can not read it. No problem, just sign again with your information but with the correct, working address.
        title: I used the wrong e-mail address to sign, what to do?
      - answer: Yes, you sign anonymously by default. The recipient of the petition and the lead petitioner can see who (your name and self description) signed from where. Only if you opted in for showing your name on the web it appears under the petition. You can reverse this by yourself anytime but it might already be archived by others in the meantime.

      <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Petities.nl only uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">cookies</a> during your visit. The website is accessible to all and can be visited anonymously. We record the internet adresses the website is served to. We use this information only to improve the website.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Your personal data</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As <a href="http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0011468/">the law (in Dutch)</a> prescribes, all personal data are only purposefully used; for the purpose you have supplied them: the recipient of a petition gets a copy of the list of signatories to verify or to get an overview of their constituency. In case of a normal petition these are your name, function and place. When extra legal requirements apply, also your street, postal code, date of birth and citizenship. For example in case of citizen’s initiative or referendum request. Nobody gets to see your e-mail address.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you sign, technical details are stored about your internet address and your browser. We show these for you to verify.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Your public profile</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On the website we show your name, function and place when you make this choice. By default you sign anonymously and your data do not show. In that case we delete your personal data from the database once the petition is answered. We keep some impersonal details: timestamp of your signature, which petition, your place and function. Make sure you do not include personal details in your place (like your address) or in your function (like the name of your company).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you indicated your public support to a petition your name, place of residence and title/description remain in the database to be served on the web. When you change your mind, you can always change this. Follow the link to your personal page you can find in our e-mails.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Copied by others</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We ask the search engines to ignore the list of signatures for a petition, but on the page of the petition there are a dozen signatures you might be in. If you end up in the search results like this and you change your signature to invisible, it might take up to a week to disappear from the search results.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Every quarter the Royal Library makes a copy of the entire site to keep for historians for example. In the Royal Library in The Hague you can consult these copies.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>E-mail from us</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you e-mail the webmaster your e-mail address is only used for correspondence regarding that question, complaint or remark. You do not receive impersonal information (like a newsletter), unless you <a href="http://service.opendomein.nl/mailman/listinfo/nieuws/">subscribe yourself to the newsletter.</a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you sign a petition, you will always receive three e-mails from webmaster@petities.nl:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>to confirm your signature, within minutes up to a day after your signature</li>
        <li>to announce the closing and hand over of the petition, weeks or months after your signature</li>
        <li>to let you know the result of the petition, within six weeks after the hand over of the petition.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you do not confirm you receive two reminders. One week after your sign and when the petition is about to close.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On top of that, the petitioner can have petities.nl e-mail about the progress to those who indicated willingness to receive such e-mails. You can indicate you do not want this by following the link from the e-mail, with which you confirmed your signature. You can find the link to your personal page also in every e-mail from us.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When you pledge help to a petition the petitioner might send you e-mail about this.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You can also indicate to receive e-mail from your municipality. In these e-mails the municipality invites you to contribute your ideas. Also these e-mails you can always stop.</p>
